## CSCI 3260 Project

### Basic Requirements

* [x] 3 Planets A, B, C
* [ ] Light source box E
* [ ] Space Vehicle D

Keep the above objects in ratio wthen changing window size with `glutReshapeFunc`

* [x] Background **skybox** without translation and zooming
* [ ] Asteroid ring cloud with at least 200 random floating rocks around C
* [x] Single texture mapping and normal mapping for A
* [x] Single texture mapping for planet B
* [ ] Single texture mapping for space vehicle D
* [ ] Single texture mapping for rock G
* [ ] Multiple texture mapping for planet C
* [x] Basic light rendering
* [ ] Self-rotation for planet A, B and C
* [ ] Planet B move around planet A
* [ ] Move around centre for light source E
* [ ] Move around A for space vehicle D
* [ ] Move around planet B for all rocks G
* [ ] 3 distinct viewpoints for choices, i.e. -X, +X, +Y axis
* [ ] Fog effect
* [\] Graphical User Interface (need connect tot the actual function)
* [ ] Keyboard Interactions, i.e. 'a', 's' and 'd' for switching viewpoints
* [ ] Speed and orbital control, i.e. &uarr; and &darr; for speed controlling, &larr; and &rarr; for changing orbit size of space vehicle D
* [ ] Mouse Interaction, i.e. zoom in and out

### Bonus Features

* [ ] Add another visible light source with Phong Illumination Model
* [ ] Collision Detection with **Landmark distance** / **Bounding box** / **Bounding sphere** Algorithm
* [ ] Provide extra viewpoints attached to space vehicles
* [ ] Real-time trajectory of space vehicle D with string (with this example: https://learnopengl.com/#!Advanced-OpenGL/Instancing tried but not success)
* [ ] Asteroid ring cloud with more than 5000 random rocks around C
* [ ] Shadow mapping, Environment mapping, Displacement mapping
* [ ] Background music with **IrrKlang** library
